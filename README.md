This project combines **deep learning feature extraction** with traditional machine learning classifiers for image classification.  
Two different pipelines were developed and compared.

## üìÇ Project Overview

- **CNN + XGBoost**  
  - Used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract deep image features.  
  - Trained an **XGBoost classifier** on the extracted features for prediction.  

- **HOG + Decision Tree**  
  - Employed **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for handcrafted feature extraction.  
  - Used a **Decision Tree classifier** to predict image classes.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Skills & Techniques

- Deep learning feature extraction with **CNNs**  
- Handcrafted feature engineering with **HOG**  
- Ensemble learning using **XGBoost**  
- Supervised classification with **Decision Trees**  
- Model evaluation and performance comparison  

## üöÄ Results

- Demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN features combined with XGBoost for robust classification.  
- Compared performance between **deep features + ML** vs. **handcrafted features + ML**.  
- Showed how feature extraction choice impacts model accuracy.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch** (for CNNs)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for HOG, Decision Tree, evaluation)  
- **XGBoost** (for classification)  
- **NumPy / Pandas** (for data handling)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
